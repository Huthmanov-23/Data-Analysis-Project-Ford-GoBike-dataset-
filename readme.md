# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration and Visualization

## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area for the month of February. The aim of this project is to explore the dataset and ask important questions of the dataset such as which hour of the day has the most bikeshare rides and which age group uses the service most often.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that the most bike rides occured during the weekdays with a dip on weekends. The most common times during the week which had the most bike rides were the 08:00 and 17:00 hours which conicides with the time people mostly leave for work and return home from work. I found that most of the bike rides were between 5 and 20 minutes, most of the members of the service were male, and the most common ages were between 20 and 40. The subscribers outnumber the casual customers, and most of the members of the service did not exercise the bike sharing option often, instead opting to ride alone. Female members tend to have a slightly higher trip durations than the male members, casual users also have higher trip duration times than subscribers. Average trip minutes during the weekdays were almost uniform with an increase during the weekends, members between the age range of 20-40 average higher trip minutes and the trip minutes decrease as the age increases. The subscribers were slightly older than the csual customers which may account for the shorter trip durations by the subscribers. Male members are also older than the female members. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on mostly on the different customer types and the member genders and their relation to the trip duration in each of thise categories. The subscribers make up most of the overall customerbase and have less trip duration minutes when compared with the casual customers, which might indicate a regular pattern of usage. Male members tend to be older than their female counterparts and therfore have less trip duration minutes.
